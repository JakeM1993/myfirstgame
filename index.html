<!-- hangman game

aims:
    start by finishing the product as just the "quick game"
    then if there is time add a "survival mode" and a "time trial" mode.

will need: 

    a database of words to draw from whenever a new game is started -> a database for each difficulty level of words (easy = 3 letter words, medium = 5 letter words, hard = 7 letter words, insane = 9+ letter words) 

---main menu---

background -> loop of the hangman picture filling up.
list of options you can select -> quick Game, time trial, survival mode, High scores, options. 

---quick game---
click on "quick game" -> select difficulty (easy, medium, hard, insane) -> game starts.


-quick game starts a game and will end the game if the hangman image is completed or if the letters are all guessed correctly. 






---survival mode---

- for survival mode each letter has a points value attached to it
( 
1 Point - A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U.
2 Points - D and G.
3 Points - B, C, M and P.
4 Points - F, H, V, W and Y.
5 Points - K.
8 Points - J and X.
10 Points - Q and Z. 
)
whenever a player completes a word a new word is loaded but they are to keep playing from where they left off with their hengman image. 


-final score = number of words completed plus total score of all letters used before hangman picture completes.

a picture of a stickman being hung -> a picture for each stage of the hang.
