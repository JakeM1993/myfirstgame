    start with one word  
    and a function for guessing letters
    whenever a letter is guessed -> check if the letter is in the word -> if it is fill that letter -> if it's not display red copy of letter off to the side and fill the first/next part of the stickman in the noose.
    create a counter -> incorrect guess adds to counter -> incorrect guess x6 = game over. -> prompt "try again" window.
